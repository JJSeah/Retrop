## Try it!
[Live demo](https://jjseah.github.io/Retrop-demo/)

## Usage
The quickest way is to use the live demo!
Other than that, you can clone this repository, and from the root run:
``` bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

This will create a ```dist``` directory. Put the contents of that directory on a server and you're all set!

_Loading/Saving works using LocalStorage, so make sure the app has permission to read/write from LocalStorage._

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run serve

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run test
```
